        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of a cooked meat patty on a bun or roll. You can order a hamburger, fries, and a shake at most fast food restaurants. Hamburgers are traditionally made with ground beef and served with onions, tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, and other garnishes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
             <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
             <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
             <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
             <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
              <li>Burger bun</li>
             <li>Lettuce</li>
             <li>Onions</li>
             <li>Tomato slices </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
            <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat the burger buns for a little crisp</li>
            <li>Put the onion slices and tomato slices altogether with the patty along with lettuce</li>
